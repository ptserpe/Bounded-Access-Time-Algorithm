# Bounded-Access-Time-Algorithm

Coding Project for the course CE522 "Mobile & Pervasive Computing".

It contains the implementation of the Bounded Access Time (BAT) algorithm in Python. The specific algorithm refers to broadcasting data in multiple channels.
The purpose of the algorithm is to create a partition of the broadcast data items such that the minimum possible access
time is achieved.
